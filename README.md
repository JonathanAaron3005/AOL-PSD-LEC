## About this project
This project was developed by my team and I to complete the Pattern Software Design course. Book-It is a simple web-based application that is used to manage books in a library system. Book-It tries 
to provide solutions to library systems that tend to be difficult to use. In this course, the emphasis is on the concept of Domain-Driven Design or DDD. Therefore, according to the project assessment, 
the development of Book-It is not concerned with the User Interface but instead focuses on developing the back end and applying the **DDD concept**. 

We conduct extensive research on the theory and practice of DDD before and during the development process. We also conducted simple research to find out the important features of the book management system in the library. After describing the 
features that will be applied, we start developing the project using the **ASP.NET framework** with the **C# language**. For the database, Microsoft SQL Server is used to store and manage data. Then, we 
model the data using the ADO.NET Entity Data Model. 

To implement the DDD concept, we also use design patterns such as **repository, factory, controller, views, bounded context**, etc. In this website, 
we provide authentication and authorization where the features that can be accessed by users are determined by their roles. Even though Book-It has a very simple interface, the development process 
gave me a new experience in developing websites using C# language.
